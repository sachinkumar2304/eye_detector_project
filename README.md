# Eye-Tracking Virtual Keyboard üñ•Ô∏èüëÅÔ∏è

A computer vision-based virtual keyboard that allows users to type using eye movements and blinks. This innovative application uses facial landmark detection to track eye movements and blinks, enabling hands-free text input.

## üéØ Overview

This project implements a complete eye-tracking virtual keyboard system that:
- **Detects facial landmarks** using MediaPipe Face Mesh
- **Tracks eye blinks** for character selection
- **Monitors nose position** for cursor movement
- **Provides real-time virtual keyboard** interface
- **Displays typed text** with live feedback

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time face detection** and landmark tracking
- **Eye blink detection** for character selection
- **Smooth cursor control** using nose position tracking
- **Virtual QWERTY keyboard** with visual feedback
- **Live camera feed** with overlay information
- **Text input and display** with character limits
- **Special keys support** (Space, Delete, Shift, Enter)
- **Movement stabilization** to prevent jittery cursor movement
- **Configurable sensitivity** and timing parameters

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV** - Computer vision and camera handling
- **MediaPipe** - Facial landmark detection
- **NumPy** - Mathematical operations and arrays

## üìã Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure you have:

1. **Python 3.7 or higher** installed
2. **Webcam** or camera device
3. **Well-lit environment** for optimal face detection
4. **Stable head position** during use

## üöÄ Installation

### Step 1: Clone or Download the Project

```bash
# If using git (recommended)
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd eye_detector1

# Or download and extract the files to a folder
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv eye_keyboard_env

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
eye_keyboard_env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source eye_keyboard_env/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Required Dependencies

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe
pip install numpy
```

**Alternative: Install all at once**
```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```

## üéÆ How to Run

### Basic Usage

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd c:/eye_detector1
   ```

2. **Activate virtual environment (if using one):**
   ```bash
   eye_keyboard_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python eye_detector.py
   ```

### What Happens Next

1. The application will start and attempt to access your camera
2. Two windows will open:
   - **"Camera"** - Live camera feed with facial landmark detection
   - **"Keyboard"** - Virtual keyboard interface
3. The system will automatically detect your face and start tracking

## üìñ How to Use

### Initial Setup
1. **Position yourself** approximately 2-3 feet from the camera
2. **Ensure good lighting** - avoid harsh shadows on your face
3. **Keep your head relatively stable** during typing
4. **Look directly at the camera** initially for face detection

### Cursor Control
- **Move your nose slightly** to control the cursor position
- **Left/Right movement** - Move nose horizontally
- **Up/Down movement** - Move nose vertically
- **Cursor sensitivity** can be adjusted in the code (`threshold` variable)

### Character Selection
- **Navigate** to the desired character using nose movements
- **Blink firmly** to select the highlighted character
- **Selected character** will be added to your text

### Special Keys
- **Space** - Inserts a space character
- **Delete** - Removes the last character
- **Shift** - Toggles between uppercase/lowercase (affects next character only)
- **Enter** - Inserts a newline character

### Text Display
- **Current selection** is highlighted in cyan/green
- **Typed text** appears at the bottom of the keyboard window
- **Recent text** is shown in the camera feed overlay

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can modify the following parameters in `eye_detector.py`:

```python
# Movement sensitivity (adjust based on your setup)
threshold = 0.04  # Lower = more sensitive

# Movement delay (prevents rapid cursor jumping)
move_delay = 0.5  # Seconds between movements

# Blink detection parameters
min_blink_duration = 0.3  # Minimum blink time (seconds)
max_blink_duration = 1.5  # Maximum blink time (seconds)

# Camera resolution
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, 640)
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, 480)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Camera not opening**
```bash
# Check if camera is available
python -c "import cv2; print(cv2.VideoCapture(0).isOpened())"
```
- Ensure no other application is using the camera
- Try restarting your computer
- Check camera permissions in your OS settings

**2. Face not detected**
- Ensure adequate lighting
- Position yourself directly in front of the camera
- Check that your face is clearly visible
- Try adjusting `min_detection_confidence` in the code

**3. Cursor not responding**
- Check camera resolution and lighting
- Adjust `threshold` value (try 0.02-0.06 range)
- Ensure stable head position
- Try reducing `move_delay` if cursor feels sluggish

**4. Blink detection issues**
- Ensure you're blinking firmly enough
- Check lighting conditions
- Adjust `min_blink_duration` and `max_blink_duration`
- Try different eye aspect ratio thresholds

**5. Poor performance**
- Close other applications
- Reduce camera resolution in the code
- Ensure adequate system resources
- Try using a different camera if available

### Performance Tips

- **Use in well-lit environments** for best detection
- **Avoid direct light sources** behind you
- **Keep consistent distance** from camera
- **Minimize background movement** for better tracking
- **Use a high-quality webcam** for better results

## üìù Usage Examples

### Basic Text Input
1. Start the application
2. Look at letters to move cursor
3. Blink to select letters
4. Type simple messages like "HELLO WORLD"

### Writing Longer Text
1. Use nose movements to navigate efficiently
2. Use "Space" key for word separation
3. Use "Enter" for new lines
4. Use "Delete" to correct mistakes

### Special Characters
- Navigate to "Shift" and blink to toggle case
- Use "Space" for word separation
- Use "Enter" for line breaks
