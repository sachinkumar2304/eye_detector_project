### Virtual Keyboard Mode (On-Screen Typing)
#### Cursor Control
- **Move your nose slightly** to control the keyboard cursor
- **Left/Right movement** - Move nose horizontally
- **Up/Down movement** - Move nose vertically
- **Cursor sensitivity** can be adjusted in the code (`MOVE_THRESHOLD` variable)

#### Character Selection
- **Navigate** to the desired character using nose movements
- **Blink firmly** to select the highlighted character
- **Selected character** will be added to your text (displayed on-screen)

#### Special Keys
- **Space** - Inserts a space character
- **Delete** - Removes the last character
- **Shift** - Toggles between uppercase/lowercase (affects next character only)
- **Enter** - Inserts a newline character

#### Text Display
- **Current selection** is highlighted in cyan/green
- **Typed text** appears at the bottom of the keyboard window
- **Recent text** is shown in the camera feed overlay

### Desktop Cursor Mode (Mouse Navigation)
#### Cursor Control
- **Move your nose** to control the desktop mouse cursor
- **Left/Right movement** - Move cursor horizontally across screen
- **Up/Down movement** - Move cursor vertically across screen
- **Cursor sensitivity** can be adjusted in the code (`MOVE_THRESHOLD` variable)

#### Scrolling
- **Close left eye** to scroll up
- **Close right eye** to scroll down
- Keep eye closed for continuous scrolling

#### Clicking
- **Blink both eyes** firmly to perform left mouse click
- Audio feedback ("Click") confirms the action

#### Floating Keyboard (OS Typing)
- **Close both eyes for 5 seconds** to trigger the floating keyboard
- A small keyboard window appears, positioned at bottom-right of screen
- **Use nose movements** to navigate keys on the floating keyboard
- **Blink** to type characters directly into the active OS application
- **Select "CLOSE_KB"** to hide the floating keyboard
- **Close eyes for 10+ seconds** to get a warning (resting too long)

### General Controls
- **ESC key** on physical keyboard to quit the application
- **'c' key** in Virtual Keyboard mode to clear typed text

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can modify the following parameters in `eye_detector.py`:

```python
# Movement sensitivity (adjust based on your setup)
MOVE_THRESHOLD = 0.003  # Lower = more sensitive

# Movement delay (prevents rapid cursor jumping)
move_delay = 0.2  # Seconds between movements (keyboard mode)
KB_NAVIGATION_DELAY = 0.4  # Slower delay for keyboard navigation

# Blink detection parameters
min_blink_duration = 0.3  # Minimum blink time (seconds)
max_blink_duration = 1.5  # Maximum blink time (seconds)

# Eye blink ratios for detection
CLICK_RATIO = 4.0  # Both eyes for click/select
SCROLL_RATIO = 4.5  # Single eye for scroll

# Timing parameters
KEYBOARD_TRIGGER_TIME = 5.0  # Seconds to trigger floating KB
MAX_EYE_CLOSE_TIME = 10.0  # Seconds for warning
BLINK_CLICK_DELAY = 0.5  # Delay between clicks

# Camera resolution
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, 640)
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, 480)

# Stabilization
stabilization_frames = 5  # Frames for averaging nose position
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
